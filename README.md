# No Fillers
For the sake of all captains, toy hammers and bike horns plus heavy wrenches get removed

You can still get them via the spawnitem command, the heavy wrench will still exist inside of the fabricator's recipes, however, you're no longer able to get that recipe with the mechanic skill tree

Note: Might not work 100% correctly with (core or similar) mods like Barotrauma 40k
